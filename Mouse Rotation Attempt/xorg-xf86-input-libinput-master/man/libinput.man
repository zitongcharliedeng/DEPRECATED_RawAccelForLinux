.SH NOTE
This is the man page for the X input driver. If you are looking for the
library documentation, go to
.BI http://wayland.freedesktop.org/libinput/doc/

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B libinput
is an Xorg input driver based on libinput.  It
therefore supports all input devices that libinput can handle, including
most mice, keyboards, tablets and touchscreens.
.PP
It is recommended that
.B libinput
devices are configured through the
.B InputClass
directive (refer to xorg.conf(5)) instead of manual
per-device configuration. Devices configured in the
xorg.conf(5) are not hot-plug capable.

.SH CONFIGURATION DETAILS
Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for general configuration
details and for options that can be used with all input drivers.  This
section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.
.PP
The following driver
.B Options
are supported:
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qAccelProfile\*q \*q" string \*q
Sets the pointer acceleration profile to the given profile. Permitted values
are
.BI adaptive,
.BI flat.
Not all devices support this option or all profiles. If a profile is
unsupported, the default profile for this device is used. For a description
on the profiles and their behavior, see the libinput documentation.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qAccelSpeed\*q \*q" float \*q
Sets the pointer acceleration speed within the range [-1, 1]
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qButtonMapping\*q \*q" string \*q
Sets the logical button mapping for this device, see
XSetPointerMapping(3). The string must be a
space-separated list of button mappings in the order of the
logical buttons on the device, starting with button 1.
The default mapping is "1 2 3 ... 32". A mapping of 0
deactivates the button. Multiple buttons can have the same mapping.
Invalid mapping strings are discarded and the default mapping
is used for all buttons. Buttons not specified in the user's mapping use the
default mapping. See section
.B BUTTON MAPPING
for more details.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qCalibrationMatrix\*q \*q" string \*q
A string of 9 space-separated floating point numbers, in the order
\*qa b c d e f g h i\*q.
Sets the calibration matrix to the 3x3 matrix where the first row is (abc),
the second row is (def) and the third row is (ghi).
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qClickMethod\*q \*q" string \*q
Enables a click method. Permitted values are
.BI none,
.BI buttonareas,
.BI clickfinger.
Not all devices support all methods, if an option is unsupported, the
default click method for this device is used.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qDisableWhileTyping\*q \*q" bool \*q
Indicates if the touchpad should be disabled while typing on the keyboard
(this does not apply to modifier keys such as Ctrl or Alt).
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qDevice\*q \*q" string \*q
Specifies the device through which the device can be accessed.  This will
generally be of the form \*q/dev/input/eventX\*q, where X is some integer.
When using
.B InputClass
directives, this option is set by the server.
The mapping from device node to hardware is system-dependent. Property:
"Device Node" (read-only).
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qDragLockButtons\*q \*q" "L1 B1 L2 B2 ..." \*q
Sets "drag lock buttons" that simulate a button logically down even when it has
been physically released. To logically release a locked button, a second click
of the same button is required.
.IP
If the option is a single button number, that button acts as the
"meta" locking button for the next button number. See section
.B BUTTON DRAG LOCK
for details.
.IP
If the option is a list of button number pairs, the first number of each
number pair is the lock button, the second number the logical button number
to be locked. See section
.B BUTTON DRAG LOCK
for details.
.IP
For both meta and button pair configuration, the button numbers are
device button numbers, i.e. the
.B ButtonMapping
applies after drag lock.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qHighResolutionWheelScrolling\*q \*q" bool \*q
Disables high-resolution wheel scroll events, enabled by default. When enabled,
the driver forwards only high-resolution wheel scroll events from libinput.
When disabled, the driver forwards legacy wheel scroll events instead.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qHorizontalScrolling\*q \*q" bool \*q
Enables or disables horizontal scrolling. When disabled, this driver will
discard any horizontal scroll events from libinput. This does not disable
horizontal scroll events from libinput; it merely discards the horizontal axis
from any scroll events. Default is enabled.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qLeftHanded\*q \*q" bool \*q
Enables left-handed button orientation, i.e. swapping left and right buttons.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qMiddleEmulation\*q \*q" bool \*q
Enables middle button emulation. When enabled, pressing the left and right
buttons simultaneously produces a middle mouse button click.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qNaturalScrolling\*q \*q" bool \*q
Enables or disables natural scrolling behavior.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qRotationAngle\*q \*q" float \*q
Sets the rotation angle of the device to the given angle, in degrees
clockwise. The angle must be between 0.0 (inclusive) and 360.0 (exclusive).
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qScrollButton\*q \*q" int \*q
Designates a button as scroll button. If the
.BI ScrollMethod
is
.BI button
and the button is logically down, x/y axis movement is converted into
scroll events.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qScrollButtonLock\*q \*q" bool \*q
Enables or disables the scroll button lock. If enabled, the
.BI ScrollButton
is considered logically down after the first click and remains down until
the second click of that button. If disabled (the default), the
.BI ScrollButton
button is considered logically down while held down and up once physically
released.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qScrollMethod\*q \*q" string \*q
Enables a scroll method. Permitted values are
.BI none,
.BI twofinger,
.BI edge,
.BI button.
Not all devices support all options, if an option is unsupported, the
default scroll option for this device is used.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qScrollPixelDistance\*q \*q" int \*q
Sets the movement distance, in "pixels", required to trigger one logical
wheel click. This option only applies to the scroll methods
.BI twofinger,
.BI edge,
.BI button.
See section
.B SCROLL PIXEL DISTANCE
for more details.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qSendEventsMode\*q \*q" (disabled|enabled|disabled-on-external-mouse) \*q
Sets the send events mode to disabled, enabled, or "disable when an external
mouse is connected".
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qTabletToolPressureCurve\*q \*q" "x0/y0 x1/y1 x2/y2 x3/y3" \*q
Set the pressure curve for a tablet stylus to the bezier formed by the four
points. The respective x/y coordinate must be in the [0.0, 1.0] range. For
more information see section
.B TABLET STYLUS PRESSURE CURVE.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qTabletToolAreaRatio\*q \*q" "w:h" \*q
Sets the area ratio for a tablet tool. The area always starts at the
origin (0/0) and expands to the largest available area with the specified
aspect ratio. Events outside this area are cropped to the area. The special
value "default" is used for the default mapping (i.e. the device-native
mapping). For more information see section
.B TABLET TOOL AREA RATIO.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qTapping\*q \*q" bool \*q
Enables or disables tap-to-click behavior.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qTappingButtonMap\*q \*q" (lrm|lmr) \*q
Set the button mapping for 1/2/3-finger taps to left/right/middle or
left/middle/right, respectively.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qTappingDrag\*q \*q" bool \*q
Enables or disables drag during tapping behavior ("tap-and-drag"). When
enabled, a tap followed by a finger held down causes a single button down
only, all motions of that finger thus translate into dragging motion.
Tap-and-drag requires option
.B Tapping
to be enabled.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qTappingDragLock\*q \*q" bool \*q
Enables or disables drag lock during tapping behavior. When enabled, a
finger up during tap-and-drag will not immediately release the button. If
the finger is set down again within the timeout, the dragging process
continues.
.PP
For all options, the options are only parsed if the device supports that
configuration option. For all options, the default value is the one used by
libinput. On configuration failure, the default value is applied.

.SH SUPPORTED PROPERTIES

.SH BUTTON MAPPING
X clients receive events with logical button numbers, where 1, 2, 3
are usually interpreted as left, middle, right and logical buttons 4, 5, 6,
7 are usually interpreted as scroll up, down, left, right. The fourth and
fifth physical buttons on a device will thus send logical buttons 8 and 9.
The
.B ButtonMapping
option adjusts the logical button mapping, it does not affect how a physical
button is mapped to a logical button.
.PP
Traditionally, a device was set to left-handed button mode by applying a
button mapping of
.B "\*q3 2 1 ...\*q"
On systems using the
.B libinput
Xorg input driver it is recommended to use the
.B LeftHanded
option instead.
.PP
The
.B libinput
Xorg input driver does not use the button mapping after setup.
Use XSetPointerMapping(3) to modify the button mapping at
runtime.

.SH BUTTON DRAG LOCK
Button drag lock holds a button logically down even when the button itself
has been physically released since. Button drag lock comes in two modes.
.PP
If in "meta" mode, a meta button click activates drag lock for the next
button press of any other button. A button click in the future will keep
that button held logically down until a subsequent click of that same
button. The meta button events themselves are discarded. A separate meta
button click is required each time a drag lock should be activated for a
button in the future.
.PP
If in "pairs" mode, each button can be assigned a target locking button.
On button click, the target lock button is held logically down until the
next click of the same button. The button events themselves are discarded
and only the target button events are sent.
.TP
This feature is provided by this driver, not by libinput.

.SH TABLET TOOL PRESSURECURVE
The pressure curve affects how stylus pressure is reported. By default, the
hardware pressure is reported as-is. By setting a pressure curve, the feel
of the stylus can be adjusted to be more like e.g. a pencil or a brush.
.PP
The pressure curve is a cubic Bezier curve, drawn within a normalized range
of 0.0 to 1.0 between the four points provided. This normalized range is
applied to the tablet's pressure input so that the highest pressure maps to
1.0. The points must have increasing x coordinates, if x0 is larger than 0.0
all pressure values lower than x0 are equivalent to y0. If x3 is less than
1.0, all pressure values higher than x3  are equivalent to y3.

The input for a linear  curve  (default) is  "0.0/0.0 0.0/0.0 1.0/1.0 1.0/1.0";
a slightly
depressed curve (firmer) might be "0.0/0.0 0.05/0.0 1.0/0.95 1.0/1.0"; a slightly raised
curve (softer) might  be "0.0/0.0 0.0/0.05 0.95/1.0 1.0/1.0".
.TP
This feature is provided by this driver, not by libinput.

.SH TABLET TOOL AREA RATIO
By default, a tablet tool can access the whole sensor area and the tablet
area is mapped to the available screen area. For external tablets like
the Wacom Intuos series, the height:width ratio of the tablet may be
different to that of the monitor, causing the skew of input data.
.PP
To avoid this skew of input data, an area ratio may be set to match the
ratio of the screen device. For example, a ratio of 4:3 will reduce the
available area of the tablet to the largest available area with a ratio of
4:3. Events within this area will scale to the tablet's announced axis
range, the area ratio is thus transparent to the X server. Any events
outside this area will send events equal to the maximum value of that axis.
The area always starts at the device's origin in it's current rotation, i.e.
it takes left-handed-ness into account.
.TP
This feature is provided by this driver, not by libinput.

.SH SCROLL PIXEL DISTANCE
The X server does not support per-pixel scrolling but it does support
smooth scrolling. All scroll events however are based around a logical
unit of scrolling (traditionally corresponding to a wheel click).
It is thus not possible to scroll by 10 pixels, but it is possible for a
driver to scroll by 1/10th of a logical wheel click.
.PP
libinput provides scroll data in pixels. The \fBScrollPixelDistance\fR
option defines the amount of movement equivalent to one wheel click. For
example, a value of 50 means the user has to move a finger by 50 pixels to
generate one logical click event and each pixel is 1/50th of a wheel click.
.SH BUGS
This driver does not work with \fBOption \*qDevice\*q\fR set to an event
node in \fI/dev/input/by-id\fR and \fI/dev/input/by-path\fR. This can be
usually be worked by using \fBSection \*qInputClass\*q\fR with an
appropriate \fBMatch*\fR statement in the xorg.conf(5).
